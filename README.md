# üç¥ YumUnity  

**YumUnity** is a modern social platform for everyone who loves sharing their culinary experiences with friends. Think of it as a *‚ÄúFacebook for food‚Äù* ‚Äì a place where users can post photos of their meals, comment on their friends‚Äô dishes, get inspired, and build a community around food.

This project was developed as a **university assignment** for the *Internet Technologies* course, demonstrating the full process of web application design and implementation.
